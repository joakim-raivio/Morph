1.36.27:
- Normalized vertical axis to avoid assert/crash with "Change Char Axis" Blueprint node.
- Disabled NetworkSmoothingMode of CharacterMovement by default.
	Linear and exponential modes have important issues if the collision capsule isn't straight.
- Added new FCharacterMoveResponseDataContainer to send the rotation of the collision capsule.
- Fixed network sync of vertical axis of the collision capsule.
	Network clients receive adjustments, movement modes shouldn't desync anymore.
- Converted LandOnAnySurface checkbox to pure boolean type to use it with TGuardValue.
- Added configurable ForceSimulateMovement checkbox to NinjaCharacterMovementComponent.
	Non-owning network clients skips simulating movement if base isn't replicated.
	Modular corridor and stands of example map aren't replicated properly (engine limitation?).

1.29.27:
- Classes updated to Unreal Engine 4.27.

1.29.26:
- Added Epic's missing code changes that were written between UE 4.22 and 4.23 releases.
- Amended incorrect notes of SmoothComponent Blueprint functions.
- Return UpVector constant in GetComponentDesiredAxisZ instead of in GetComponentAxisZ.
- Added SetCharMovementAxis Blueprint callable function to NinjaCharacter.
	"Change Char Axis" node allows rotating the collision capsule and force-walk unwalkable surfaces.
	"On Unwalkable Hit" event is triggered when the collision capsule bumps into an unwalkable blocking object.
	"Trigger Unwalkable Hits" checkbox controls unwalkable hit events.
- Used a quaternion to rotate the ControlRotation in OnCharMovementAxisChanged.
- Added GetAxisZ function of an FRotator in NinjaMath.
- Replaced uses of 0,0,-1 vector with DownVector constant.
- Used HALF_PI constant instead of PI/2.
- Deleted unneeded trigger of 1.3 example because OnMovementModeChanged's code was changed to rotate around center of collision capsule.

1.20.26:
- Allowed simulated NinjaCharacters to find any floor while falling if LandOnAnySurface is marked.
- Remade MakeFromZQuat function: now it flips control rotation when capsule rotates 180 degrees (if applicable).
	Harsh 90 degrees rotation of NinjaCharacter is also improved.
- Replaced use of SCENECOMPONENT_ROTATOR_TOLERANCE number with the configuration value called ThresholdParallelAngle.
- NinjaCharacter logs error and doesn't smooth Mesh if NetworkSmoothingMode of CharacterMovement is enabled.
	Allows smooth interpolation of attached skeletal mesh component in remotely controlled NinjaCharacters.
- Added NinjaFallVelocity to NinjaPhysicsVolume that imparts a falling velocity to entering walking NinjaCharacters.

1.15.26:
- Re-release to fix outdated .uplugin file.

1.14.26:
- Cleanup of unneeded SupportedPrograms section in .uplugin file.
- Fixed ComputeGroundMovementDeltaEx function to allow no delta movement offset to avoid assert/crash.
- Improved crouch offset support for attached skeletal mesh component in NinjaCharacter.
	Mesh crouch offset works properly if using absolute world position (happens with smooth interpolation).
- Disallowed smooth interpolation of attached skeletal mesh component in remotely controlled NinjaCharacters.
- Added SmoothComponentLocation/SmoothComponentRotation Blueprint callable functions to NinjaCharacter.
- Simplified Blueprint graph of NinjaDumbCharacter05_BP example.
	No need to cache initial relative location and rotation for the attached skeletal mesh component.

1.08.26:
- Classes updated to Unreal Engine 4.26.

1.08.25:
- Added generic code in NinjaMath that determines if two unit vectors are orthogonal/parallel.
- Added configurable ThresholdParallelAngle float to NinjaCharacterMovementComponent.
	Reducing this value improves perceived smoothness of certain rotation calculations, allowing more collision capsule rotations on moving bases.
- Added Help folder with 'Changelog' and 'How to use' text files.
- Transformed wrong Client RPCs into NetMulticast RPCs in NinjaCharacterMovementComponent.
- Added SmoothComponentLocationAndRotation Blueprint callable function to NinjaCharacter.
	Smoothly interpolates location and rotation of an attached component; check 1.5 section in example map.

1.03.25:
- Fixed missing UPROPERTY categories to fix broken game packaging for some configurations.

1.01.25:
- Initial release.
